# Mitochondrial phylogenomics (Mitophylogenomics)
<div align="justify">
  
This is a curated repository of mitophylogenomics studies that I am involved in through collaborative initiatives. These studies encompass a range of taxa, including insects, seabirds, and elasmobranchs (sharks and rays). Here, you will find the data and code, if relevant.

## Mitophylogenomics Part I: Carcharhiniformes (Ground Sharks)
<div align="justify">
  
This study is a component of Ms. Jessica Winn's doctoral project at the Genetics Department of Stellenbosch University in South Africa, where I serve as an Extraordinary Senior Lecturer and Jessica's Ph.D. co-supervisor. All the comprehensive information regarding this project is stored in a dedicated GitHub repository. Please see here: https://github.com/JessWinn/Houndshark-Mitogenomics. The full research article is available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4496805 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4496805 as a preprint and it is currently undergoing a second round of revisions in the journal *Genomics*.

## Mitophylogenomics Part II: Lepidoptera (Butterflies and Moths)
<div align="justify">
  
This folder contains the assembled mitochondiral genome of the apple fruit moth, *Argyresthia conjugella*, reported in our furthercomming paper currently under revision in the journal *BMC Genomics* titled "Novel insight into lepidopteran phylogenetics from the mitochondrial genome of the apple fruit moth of the family Argyresthiidae". The full research article is available on *Research Square* as a preprint. Please visit the link https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3170057/v1 to access the full paper. The assembled mitochondiral genome is currently pending release on GenBank (Accession number: ON496993).

## Mitophylogenomics Part III: Phalacrocoracidae (Cormorants and Shags)
<div align="justify">

This study is a component of Ms. Debbie Stanbridge's research internship project at the Reel Science Coalition NPO in South Africa and has its own dedicated GitHub repository currently under restricted access.
