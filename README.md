# Mitochondrial phylogenomics (Mitophylogenomics)
<div align="justify">
  
This is a curated repository of mitophylogenomics studies that I am involved in through collaborative initiatives. These studies encompass a range of taxa, including fish, insects, seabirds, and elasmobranchs (sharks and rays). Here, you will find the data and code, if relevant.

## Mitophylogenomics Part I: Cottoidei (Sculpins, Sandfishes, and Snailfishes)
<div align="justify">

This study was a component of my postdoctoral research at the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research (NIBIO). The full paper is published online here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2022.110297.

## Mitophylogenomics Part II: Lepidoptera (Butterflies and Moths)
<div align="justify">
  
This folder contains the assembled mitochondiral genome of the apple fruit moth, *Argyresthia conjugella*, reported in our research paper now published online in the journal *BMC Genomics* titled "Novel insight into lepidopteran phylogenetics from the mitochondrial genome of the apple fruit moth of the family Argyresthiidae". Please visit the link [https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3170057/v1](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-023-09905-1) to access the full paper. The assembled mitochondiral genome is also available on GenBank undder the Accession number ON496993.

## Mitophylogenomics Part III: Carcharhiniformes (Ground Sharks)
<div align="justify">
  
This study is a component of Ms. Jessica Winn's doctoral project at the Genetics Department of Stellenbosch University in South Africa, where I serve as an Extraordinary Senior Lecturer and Jessica's Ph.D. co-supervisor. All the comprehensive information regarding this project is stored in a dedicated GitHub repository. Please see here: https://github.com/JessWinn/Houndshark-Mitogenomics. The full research article is now published online in the journal *Genomics* titled "A comprehensive phylogenomic study unveils evolutionary patterns and challenges in the mitochondrial genomes of Carcharhiniformes: A focus on Triakidae". Please visit the link https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2023.110771 to access the full paper.

## Mitophylogenomics Part IV: Phalacrocoracidae (Cormorants and Shags)
<div align="justify">

This study is a component of Ms. Debbie Stanbridge's research internship project at the Reel Science Coalition NPO in South Africa and has its own dedicated GitHub repository currently under restricted access.
